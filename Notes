Download the raspberry pi OS on the sd card. 
Connect the raspberry pi camera to the Pi and change the Pi preferences using the CMD: sudo raspi-config
  - Enable legacy support of camera
  - Enable I2C and SPI (just in csae). 
  - Enable VNC if you plan to remote in to the camera
  - Restart the pi
 Check if the camera is working using the following :
  - raspistill -o test.jpg (The camera shows preview for 5 seconds before turnning off)
  if there are any errors please try the following:
    - vcgencmd get_camera
      - The output from this must be "supported=1 detected=1", if not then there could be camera hardware issues. 
    if you see "supported=1 detected=1" and the camera still doesn't work please try the following:
      - Go to the /boot/config.txt file and add "start_debug=1" at the end of file.
        - type: sudo vcdbg log assert
        - if the error is something like this" vcdbg_ctx_get_dump_stack: dump_stack failed" it means there is some other resource using the camera. 
          - Try changing the GPU memory to 256MB and see if it helps, check all processes (ps -aux).
          - Make sure i2c is enabled in raspi-config
          - Last resort is to reinstall the OS , that's what helped me. 
    
    - Some other camera debug comands:
      - vcgencmd version
      - uname -a
      - dmesg
  
Once the camera works, install pycharm.

Upon pycharm installation, run it. There could be a java error. Run the following commands to get over the java error :
  - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt install default-jdk

Now setup pycharm to use venv python 3.x that came. 
use the scripts from my "home_atutomation" folder to test the picam, PIR sensor and other things. 

In order to save the videos on the network, conenct a storage to the router/ network to make ti work like NAS. 
  Make sure to format the disk using the following commands in linux:
  - df
  - sudo umount /dev/sda1
  - sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sda1
  Access this folder from windows using \\IP\folder_name and see if you can access. 
  Make sure to password protect the folder just in case. 


Next steps: 
- save the video on network drive instead of local drive
- Look for an open source android app to show live feed. pushover is one of them but i need to check it.
